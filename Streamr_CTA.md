# Welcome to the Streamr Community! 🎉
## What is Streamr?
Streamr is a distributed open-source software project striving to create a decentralized data economy over a peer-to-peer network. At the heart is the Streamr Network, which transports streams of real-time data from publishers to subscribers. Currently, we're working towards the Brubeck release in 2021, which will enable community run network nodes.
