# Welcome to the Streamr Community! 🎉
## What is Streamr?
The Streamr project raised 30M CHF in an ICO in late 2017 to build the world’s first decentralised pub/sub data network. The project has completed various milestones and is currently working towards the Brubeck release in 2021, which enables community run network nodes.
